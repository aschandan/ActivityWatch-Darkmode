# ActivityWatch-Darkmode
  A css theme made for ActivityWatch, an open-sourced time tracker: https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch.

  While the code has been mostly optimized for my side, it should work fine with other clients. I have not documented the .css very well, but in due time I shall add more clarity for what each thing gets changed.

## How do I add the css?
  To implement the css, locate your AppData, go to Local, Programs, ActivityWatch, aw-server, aw-server, static, and then css. Replace the files or manually enter in the changes to the files and save. 

## But what about Linux and Mac?
  I am sorry, but I do not know the method of introducting this to Linux or Mac; To locate the program, you should go to the file location of where is installed / located. My apolgies for being unable to help with this.

## Do I have to replace the css files?
  Honestly no, you could use greasemonkey or some other kind of program that replaces the css of the websites without having to manually replace the code itself. I only did this to make my life easier and as a learning experience.

## This theme broke my program!
  I am sorry, but I am not fully responsible for what could happen. While the css has been working fine for me, I cannot confirm it may not cause issues for others who use it. So please, use this at your own risk. If this does ever happen though, reinstalling the program resets the theme and keeps your information.
